        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: February 15, 2026</p>

        <p>
          DZN ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This
          Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and
          disclosed by DZN. This Privacy Policy applies to our website, and its
          associated subdomains (collectively, our "Service") alongside our application,
          DZN. By accessing or using our Service, you signify that you have read,
          understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your
          personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of
          Service.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
        <p>We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact us for support or with questions.</li>
          <li>Provide feedback or review our App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device,
            including the hardware model, operating system version, unique device
            identifiers, and mobile network information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage Data: We collect anonymous information about how you use our
            application, such as features used and time spent on the app, to help us
            improve the user experience.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Photo Library Access</h3>
        <p>
          To provide the core functionality of the App (editing photos and creating
          carousels), we require access to your device's photo library.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Local Processing: We prioritize your privacy. All photo processing and
            editing are performed locally on your device. We do not upload your photos
            to our servers or any third-party cloud storage unless explicitly initiated
            by you (e.g., for sharing or cloud backup features).
          </li>
          <li>
            Permission: You can revoke access to your photo library at any time in your
            device settings, though this will limit the App's functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>
